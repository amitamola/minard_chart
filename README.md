This is a reproduction of [Minard's chart](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcommons.wikimedia.org%2Fwiki%2FFile%3AMinard.png%23%2Fmedia%2FFile%3AMinard.png) of Napoleon's Russian Campaign using Matplotlib Python. The data is from the [Minard's chart of Napoleon's Russian campaign](https://www.rpubs.com/Minh_Bui/257561)

And here's the final result:
